AVR IPMI

A simple firmware designed for small Arduinos (eg the Mini) to be
embedded in a cheap server and serve a simple HTTP interface over an
attached ethernet port to remotely control the host server (power
on/off, possibly serial console).

Currently a major work in progress. It is still a prototype, if you're
reading this now then expect to read and modify the source code if you
want to use it.
